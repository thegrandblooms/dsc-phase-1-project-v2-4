This is the Q1 project for Flatiron School with the objective of creating a professional-level analysis and presentation. The scenario here is supposing that Microsoft is wanting to enter the streaming and film industry - how can data about movies help with this process?

5 Datasets are supplied, of which three were chosen and incorporated into the analysis and presentation in the jupyter notebook and pdf. The PDF is a slide presentation intended to accompany a zoom meeting with a non-technical audience, while the jupyter notebook contains code and comments for a technical data-science audience.

The jupyter notebook imports the data, cleans it up and combines databases, and then performs some exploratory data analysis. This data analysis incorporates the creation of graphs and graphics. These graphics can be found in the 'graphics' folder.
